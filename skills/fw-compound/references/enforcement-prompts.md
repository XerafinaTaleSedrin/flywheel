# Enforcement Prompts

Reference file for `/fw:compound`. Contains redirect and warning text for the compound skill.

Enforcement levels (redirect → warn → let the output speak) are defined in `AGENTS.md`. The compound skill uses lighter enforcement than `/fw:position` or `/fw:copy` — it's a capture tool, not a framework — but still enforces specificity. This file contains the skill-specific redirect and warning text for `/fw:compound`.

## Step 1: Extract the Learning

### Restating what's already saved

**Redirect:** "That's already captured in [file]. The canvas records your decisions, and the copy test records the draft and drift report. What I'm looking for is what you learned that ISN'T in those files — what surprised you, what was harder than expected, or what you'd do differently next time."

**Warn:** "This learning overlaps significantly with what's already in [file]. Saving it anyway, but future sessions may surface both — which could feel redundant."

### Vague learning: "It went well" / "I learned a lot"

**Redirect:** "What specifically? Which claim resonated? Which segment responded? What was the actual response — a click, a reply, a follow-up question, a blank stare? One specific observation is worth more than ten vague ones."

**Warn:** "Saving a general observation. It won't be very useful for future sessions because there's nothing specific to match against. Consider coming back with concrete results."

### No actionable implication

**Redirect:** "That's an interesting observation, but how should it change what we do? Should it update the canvas? Change which claims we emphasize? Inform which artifact types we prioritize? A learning without an implication is trivia — what makes it useful is knowing what to do about it."

### Learning based on a single data point

**Redirect (for cross-session patterns):** "That's one session. A pattern needs at least 2-3 supporting data points. For now, I'd save this as an observation on the specific artifact rather than a pattern. Want to add it to that file's Outcome Notes instead?"

## Step 2: Conflict Detection

### User wants to quietly override a prior decision

**Redirect:** "This new learning contradicts what you decided on [date] in [file]: '[prior decision]'. That's not a problem — positioning evolves. But I need you to decide explicitly: update the prior decision, archive it, keep both with different contexts, or discard the new learning. Quietly overwriting loses the history of why you changed."

### User wants to keep contradictory decisions

**Warn:** "Keeping both means future sessions might surface conflicting guidance. That's fine if the distinction between when each applies is clear. Make sure the context note explains when the old decision applies vs. the new one."

---

## General: Nothing to Compound

**Redirect:** "Not every session produces a learning worth saving separately. The canvas already captures your positioning decisions, and the copy test captures the draft and drift report. If those files cover everything, there's nothing extra to compound — and that's fine. The system is working as designed."

## General: Trying to Save Without Specificity

**Redirect:** "The compound skill exists to capture what the other skills don't — meta-insights about the process and patterns. If you can't point to something specific that surprised you or changed your thinking, the right answer might be 'nothing to compound this time.' That's a sign the session went cleanly, not a failure."
